#this is the first exercise of python using operator 

a = 50
b = 60 
print(" the value of a+b is :",a+b)
print(" the value of a-b is :",a-b)

print(" the value of a/b is :",a/b)
print(" the value of a*b is :",a*b)

#this is a simple calculation to know the concept of operator and without taking the input from the user
